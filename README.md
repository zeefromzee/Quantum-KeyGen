# .*･Quantum-Inspired Key Generator & NIST Randomness Test Suite･*.☆

Welcome to the ✧✧ quantum-inspired cryptographic key generator project, paired with a comprehensive randomness analytics suite. This system simulates quantum entropy extraction and applies NIST-grade randomness testing to help you generate and validate secure keys.

## ｡･:*:･ﾟ✧ Highlights ✧･:*:･ﾟ｡

◇ **Quantum-Inspired Key Generation**  
  - Harvests entropy from webcam pixel noise  
  - Dynamically overlays geometric measurement bases (rectangle, circle, ellipse)  
  - Generates AES-256 strength keys using SHA-512, HKDF, and system randomness  
  - Logs every key and its entropy measurement into `enc.csv` ☆

◇ **Refined GUI Experience**  
  - Interactive interface using [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)  
  - One-click key generation and instant randomness evaluation  
  - Live entropy graph, key preview, and measurement overlays  

◇ **NIST SP 800-22 Statistical Suite**  
  - Implements 5 canonical randomness tests:  
    - Monobit Frequency ⋆  
    - Runs  
    - Longest Run of Ones ✧  
    - Spectral  
    - Approximate Entropy  
  - Detailed aggregate statistics and pass rates for every key batch

## ⋆ How It Works ⋆

> **Quantum-inspired, not hardware QRNG:**  
> Uses webcam noise + cyber magic—not physical quantum hardware.

- **Key Generation:**  
   1. Grabs webcam frame, overlays a random geometric basis  
   2. Pixel region's entropy is measured (Shannon formula)  
   3. Region data, salt, and system randomness are hashed & expanded  
   4. Resulting key is logged with its entropy

- **Randomness Testing:**  
   1. Loads all keys from the CSV log  
   2. Converts each hex key to a binary string  
   3. Applies all five NIST randomness tests  
   4. Aggregates and prints summary statistics for each test

## ✧･ﾟRequirementsﾟ･✧

- Webcam  
- Python 3.7+  
- Required packages: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `customtkinter`, `pandas`, `cryptography`, `scipy`

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib customtkinter pandas cryptography scipy
```

---

## ⋆ Usage ⋆

1. **Launch GUI:**
   ```bash
   python NIST_TESTS_ALGO.py
   ```
   - "Generate Key": start key creation (entropies log instantly!)
   - "Do a randomness test": review NIST results on the whole batch  
   - Keyboard controls: ESC (exit), P (pause/resume), S (screenshot)

2. **Headless Batch Test:**  
   ```python
   from NIST_TESTS_ALGO import test_key_randomness
   test_key_randomness("enc.csv") ```

3. **Graph Generated from Entropy Data:**

**Visual evidence of batch test results:**  
```
- ★ Monobit: _99.0% pass rate (1139/1150)_, average p-value: 0.5090  
- ★ Runs: _99.0% pass rate_, average p-value: 0.4917  
- ★ Longest Run: _99.1% pass rate_, average p-value: 0.4974  
- ★ Spectral: _98.2% pass rate_, average p-value: 0.4676  
- ★ Approximate Entropy: _95.5% pass rate_, average p-value: 0.1618  

These results showcase robust randomness and consistently high statistical quality across all evaluated tests. Your keys, as processed by the suite, meet stringent randomness criteria—a sparkling reassurance for cryptographic reliability.･ﾟ✧
